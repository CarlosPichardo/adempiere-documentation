# Installing ADempiere Manually

## General Installation Instructions

The database and application server can be installed on a single computer or multiple computers.   Demonstrations and small installations can easily be handled by a single server but larger companies will benefit from dedicated database and application servers in a more complex and secure environment.

These installation instructions are intended for initial installations and cover the basic installation requirements.  For installation in larger complex environments, additional security concerns may need to be addressed.  See Securing Your ADempiere Installation.

The installation process is similar across operating systems with a few minor exceptions and involves the following steps:

1. [Database Server Installation and Setup](database-server-installation-and-setup.md)
2. [Application Server Installation and Setup](application-server-installation-and-setup.md)
3. [Initialize the Database](initialize-the-database.md)
4. [Launch the Application Server](launch-the-application-server.md)

The details of each step are covered in the following sections.
