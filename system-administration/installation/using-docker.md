# Using Docker

Docker is an open platform for developers and system administrators to build, ship, and run applications. With Docker, you can create a demonstration in a local environment or run an instance from the latest ADempiere revision directly from the source, without having to deal with the details of installation for all the stack components.

**Docker is not intended to replace software development environments or version control with GitHub. It is rather an additional alternative to share instances of ADempiere for testing or demonstration.**

To use Docker to evaluate ADempiere, first download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your target computer.
