# Version Control

The documentation collection is maintained in GitHub at [https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere-documentation](https://github.com/adempiere/admpiere-documentation). Corrections and updates can be made through pull-requests to that repository.

The goal is to maintain the set of documentation in parallel with the software so individual software releases will have corresponding documentation releases. Branches in the documentation repository will mirror the main branches in the software repository with the "master" branch being the most current release. Editing work should be done in the "develop" branch.  Tags will identify version releases.

To contribute, you will need an account on [GitHub](http://github.com). Fork the [ADempiere-Documentation](https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere-documentation) repository to your GitHub account.

Create or login to your account on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) and create a space linked to your GitHub fork of the ADempiere documentation. When you specify the branches to sync with your GitHub account, use the following branch names:

`master doc* release* contrib*`

Use GitBook to make your edits in your fork. When you have made your edits, use Github to create a pull-request on the main ADempiere repository.

GitHub provides excellent documentation on making pull requests. Be sure to target the correct branch in the main repository when making the pull request.  One suggested approach is to create a new branch in GitHub for your edits, basing the branch on the master branch.  Then, when your edits are complete, use GitHub to make a pull request from your new branch back to the master branch.
