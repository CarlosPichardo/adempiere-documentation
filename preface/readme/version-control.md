# Version Control

The documentation collection is maintained in GitHub at [https://github.com/adempiere/admpiere-documentation](https://github.com/adempiere/admpiere-documentation). Corrections and updates can be made through pull-requests to that repository.

The goal is to maintain the set of documentation in parallel with the software so individual software releases will have corresponding documentation releases. Branches in the documentation repository will mirror the main branches in the software repository with the Master branch being the most current release. Tags will identify version releases.

To contribute, you will need an account on Github. Fork the Adempiere-Documentation repository to your github account and either edit the documents in your preferred editor or use the on-line tool Gitbook \([https://www.gitbook.com/\](https://www.gitbook.com/\)\). You can link a book to your repository. When you have made your edits, use Github to create a pull-request on the main ADempiere repository.

Github provides excellent documentation on making pull requests. Be sure to target the correct branch in the main repository when making the pull request.
